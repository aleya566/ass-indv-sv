    ### Interpretation
    Each bar represents a category of **Sleep Quality**. The segments within each bar show the **proportion** of students in that sleep quality group who reported a specific **Academic Performance** rating.
    This chart is **interactive**:
    * **Hover** over the bars to see exact proportions.
    * **Click** on legend items to hide/show specific academic performance categories.
    * **Zoom** and **Pan** the chart using the tools on the top-right.
